Main(spectraFilename)

Description: 
This is the main portion of the code. It calls the other functions used. It's main function is to: 
call the Spectrum class, do the radial velocity measurements, 
cross correlate the lines to get the inital spectral type and metallicity guess, bring up the GUI. 

Input: 
spectraFilename - a list of the filenames of each of the spectra to be classified (one per line), 
and the corresponding filetype (i.e., sdssfits, fits, txt, etc.)

Output: 
autoSpTResults.tbl - list of the spectra with the results of the auto spectral typing and metallicity results.
