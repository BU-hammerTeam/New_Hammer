# New_Hammer
BU_pycon's new hammer code: A Python Spectral Typing Suite (modeled after Covey+07: The Hammer)

CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, USE AT OWN RISK!

Running the code: In the New\_Hammer folder, run pyHammer by typing python pyHammer.py. The first time you run the code type python pyHammer.py -h to see all the options available to run. For each run, you will need an input file that contains a list of all the spectra you would like to classify, along with what filetype each one is. An example of this file is available (test_case/exampleInputFile.txt). The filetypes accepted are .txt, .csv, SDSS EDR - DR8 (DR7fits), SDSS DR9 - DR12 (DR12fits), fits.
